# Blockchain Case Study

As described in the primary README at the "top" of this repository (found [here](../README.md) in case you're lost) this document is a case study of RECUR and how it is using the blockchain to solve the problem of a fragmented blockchain and NFT space.

## RECUR - Bridging the NFT Divide

![Oops, image not available.](./Images/RECUR-logo.png "RECUR Logo")

The subject of this briefcase study is a US-based company called RECUR.  One could strictly say they are still in their startup phase and not fully operational, however, one of their first projects is to be released in the lead up to Christmas 2021, if not sooner.

## Who is RECUR?

RECUR "designs & develops on-chain branded experiences that allow fans to buy, collect, and re-sell digital products and collectibles (NFTs)" ([1][1]).

So, while the above phrase is their primary phrase describing a focus on "on-chain branded experiences", for me - and the reason they are the subject of this case study - is the importance of their vision and what their platform will accomplish over the coming years.

RECUR's platform (Ethereum-based) will not only be where a number of NFTs are created and held, and in its own right will be successful.  The key differentiator of what RECUR is accomplishing, is their vision of being chain-agnostic ([2][2]) and a focus on ensuring both the NFTs themselves and their royalties *remain* decentralised.

## What is RECUR trying to solve?

RECUR's vision is to realise two primary goals, firstly they want to enable the creation of NFTs within an environment that is brand-led and thus attract mass-market appeal (also read, hype) and adoption.

Secondly, their aim is to be chain-agnostic and therefore are opening up the possibility that NFTs created ***anywhere*** could end up on their platform or if created on RECUR could similarly be transferred to another platform/network. 

### Keeping it decentralised!

This will fundamentally change the NFT market, in that it sets up "the standard for a decentralized recurring royalty, creating the widest distribution and reach for NFTs minted on their platform" ([3][3])

With so many NFT projects in existence and a whole lot more on their way "to a blockchain near you", what has tended to happen in more recent times is the NFTs are traded on the open market on *centralised* platforms, e.g. [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) or [Rarity](https://rarity.tools/) and thus off-chain where revenue is realised.

## Impact of what RECUR are doing?

NFT use-cases are fairly fixed, but then also still open to new possibilities.  Examples of NFTs are any digital asset that can be traded on-chain, so theoretically open to anything, most times digital-only, but in some cases physical too (i.e. digital contract for a physical object) although the latter is not particularly well suited to fast-paced trading.  Branded cards, art, songs, writings, other digital assets, in-game/virtual-world items ... and the list goes on.

Theoretically, the NFT market will explode, assuming this platform proves successful that is, for one primary reason which is that the focus on recurring revenue and royalties for original content as well as the revenue remaining decentralised, is the key.

A potential detractor for what RECUR's platform will provide, is for many networks/platforms who are in competition with each other, all jostling for position to "be the best NFT chain", could mean that having NFTs not tied to one chain, would mean that chain would need to continue growing on its own merits or risk becoming unpopular and thus losing market share.  A case in point is the current debate (2021) between whether Solana or Ethereum or Binance Smartchain will end up being "the one".  

On the flip side though, with a platform that is chain-agnostic, the goal is to create mass-attraction and thus by RECUR creating openness, will create a landscape which is attractive for all and not benefitting one platform/chain/project over another.

## Where are RECUR going?

It is still early in the game for RECUR.  Their unwavering focus on creating a platform for all, means they have a lot of work ahead of them but with a pretty bright future in terms of their potential impact.  

They are not messing about; the founders have pedegree in the industry.  Trevor George and Zach Bruch are the founders and co-CEOs and both having come from the finance and crypto have a good understanding of the current challenges the crypto space imposes for most who wish to participate.

They have brought on Stephen Teglas as President, who is the former SVP of Licensing at Disney.  
Their Head of Engagement Chris Heatherly is the former EVP of Games for NBC Universal and was ***also*** SVP of Games for Disney, and their CTO, James Seibel is the former Director of Engineering at Poloniex ([2][2]).

They are serious about their mission!

## Other Case Study Candidates

There were a number of other candidates that were considered for this case study, among which is a UK Crypto Asset Management Software provider called [Copper](https://copper.co/). Copper makes it easy for new Crypto projects, companies, startups or ventures to more easily get up to speed with robust digital asset infrastructure, including comprehensive wallet management (cold storage included)

The other, was a small Perth-based Australian company, [Bamboo](https://www.getbamboo.io/), which provide ludicrously simple access to owning Crypto via their easy-to-use smartphone App.  Bamboo allows users to dollar cost-average into crypto with amounts as low as cents, yes, under a dollar!  This is how wealth is created!
